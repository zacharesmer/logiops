<p>
    Logid uses a standard libconfig-style config file stored in <code>/etc/logid.cfg</code> by default (although you
    launch logid with
    the -c option to change it).
</p>

<p>
    The config style may change in the future, however backwards-compatibility will be maintained.
</p>

<p>
    For a sample config, see <a href="https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops/blob/master/logid.example.cfg"
        target="_blank">logid.example.cfg</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <code>:</code> and <code>=</code> are used for defining variables and are interchangeable. (e.g.
    <code>name: "foo";</code> is the same as <code>name =
"foo";</code>)

<h3>
    Ignoring Devices
</h3>
<p>
    Devices can be ignored from being detected and used in logid. To ignore a device, create a field called
    <code>ignore</code> as an array of the PIDs of the devices you want to ignore. e.g. <code>ignore: [0x00a7]</code>
</p>


<h3>Defining Devices</h3>
Devices are defined in an array field called <code>devices</code>. This array consists of objects that define a device.

e.g. <code>devices: ( { device object }, { device object } ... );</code>

The following are a list of fields that a device object contains.
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>name</strong>
        This is a required string field that defines the name of the device. To get the name of the device, launch logid
        with the device connected and it should print out a message with the device name. (e.g.
        <code>name: "MX Master";</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>buttons</strong>
        This is an optional array field that defines the mappings for buttons.

        e.g. <code>buttons: ( { button object }, { button object } ... );</code>
        <ul>
            Button Objects
            <li>
                <strong>cid</strong>
                This is a required integer field that defines the Control ID of the button that is being remapped. (e.g.
                <code>cid: 0xc4;</code>)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>action</strong>
                This is a required object field that defines the new action of the button. (e.g.
                <code>action: { ... };</code> )
            </li>
            Refer to the actions section for more information.
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>dpi</strong>
        This is an optional integer/array field that defines the DPI for a mouse that supports adjustable DPI. (e.g.
        <code>dpi:
        1000;</code>)

        If your mouse has multiple sensors, you may define separate DPIs for those sensors by using an array and placing
        the
        value in the sensor's index (e.g. sensor 0: 1000 dpi, sensor 1: 800 dpi -> <code>dpi: [1000, 800]</code>)

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>smartshift</strong>
        This is an optional object field that defines the SmartShift settings for a mouse that supports it.

        <code>
        smartshift:
        {
        on: true;
        threshold: 30;
        default_threshold: 30;
        };
        </code>

    </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>on</strong>
            This is an optional boolean field that defines whether SmartShift should be activated. (<code>true</code>
            for
            SmartShift,
            <code>false</code>
            for free-spin).

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>threshold</strong>
            This is an optional integer field between 1-255 that defines the threshold required to change the SmartShift
            wheel to
            free-spin.

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>default_threshold</strong>
            This is an optional integer field between 1-255 that defines the mouse's default threshold required to
            change
            the
            SmartShift wheel to free-spin.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <li>
        <strong>hiresscroll</strong>
        This is an optional object field that defines the HiRes mouse-scrolling settings for a device that supports it.

        <code>
        hiresscroll:
        {
        hires: true;
        invert: false;
        target: false;
        };
        </code>
    </li>


    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>hires</strong>
            This is an optional boolean field that defines whether the mouse wheel should be high resolution or not.

        </li>

        <li><strong>invert</strong>
            This is an optional boolean field that defines whether to invert the mouse wheel.

        </li>

        <li><strong>target</strong>
            This is an optional boolean field that defines whether mousewheel events should send as an HID++
            notification or
            work
            normally (<code>true</code> for HID++ notification, <code>false</code> for normal usage). This option must
            be set to true to remap
            the
            scroll
            wheel action.

        </li>
        <li><strong>up</strong>
            This is a gesture that defines the action that will be taken when the scroll wheel is moved up (down if
            inverted). Refer
            to the Actions/Gestures section for further info. To function, this field requires target to be enabled.

        </li>

        <li><strong>down</strong>
            This is a gesture that defines the action that will be taken when the scroll wheel is moved down (up if
            inverted). Refer
            to the Actions/Gestures section for further info. To function, this field requires target to be enabled.

        </li>
    </ul>


    <li><strong>thumbwheel</strong>
        This is an optional object field that defines the thumb wheel settings on a device that supports it (e.g. MX
        Master 3).

        Some devices will not support the proxy, touch, and tap fields. Thumb wheel capabilities can be determined by
        running
        logid in debug mode and looking at the output.


        <ul>
            <li><strong>divert</strong>
                This is a boolean field that determines whether the thumb wheel should be handled by logid
                (<code>true</code>) or
                the
                OS
                (<code>false</code>).

            </li>

            <li><strong>invert</strong>
                This is a boolean field that determines whether the thumb wheel's scrolling should be diverted.
            </li>

            <li><strong>left</strong>
                This is an optional gesture that defines the action that will be taken when the scroll wheel is moved
                left
                (right if
                inverted). Refer to the Actions/Gestures section for further info. To function, this field requires
                divert
                to be
                enabled.

            </li>

            <li><strong>right</strong>
                This is an optional gesture that defines the action that will be taken when the scroll wheel is moved
                right
                (left if
                inverted). Refer to the Actions/Gestures section for further info. To function, this field requires
                divert
                to be
                enabled.

            </li>

            <li><strong>proxy</strong>
                This is an optional action that defines what will occur when the user is in proximity of the thumb
                wheel.
                (will be
                pressed upon entering proximity, released upon leaving). Refer to the Actions section for further info.

            </li>

            <li><strong>touch</strong>
                This is an optional action that defines what will occur when the user touches the thumb wheel. (will be
                pressed upon
                touching the thumb wheel, released upon letting go). Refer to the Actions section for further info.

            </li>

            <li><strong>tap</strong>
                This is an optional action that defines what will occur when the user taps the thumb wheel once.
                (Pressed
                and
                immediately released after tap). Refer to the Actions section for further info.

            </li>
        </ul>

    </li>

    <li><strong>Actions</strong>


        <ul>
            <li><strong>type</strong>
                This is a required string field that defines the type of action. (e.g. <code>type: "None";</code>). The
                following
                is a list of possible actions with their additional fields.

                <ul>

                    <li><strong>None</strong>
                        This does nothing. There are no additional fields.

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Keypress </strong>
                        This maps press and release events of a button to a list of keys/buttons. <ul>
                            <li><strong>keys </strong>
                                This is a required string/integer array/list field that defines the keys to be
                                pressed/released. For a list of key/button strings, refer to <a
                                    href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h"
                                    target="_blank">linux/input-event-codes.h</a>.
                                (e.g. <code>keys: ["KEY_A", "KEY_B"];</code>). Alternatively, you may use integer
                                keycodes to
                                define the keys. Please note that these event codes work in a US (QWERTY) keyboard
                                layout. If you have a locale set that does not use this keyboard layout, please map it
                                to whatever key it would be on a QWERTY keyboard. (e.g. "KEY_Z" on a QWERTZ layout
                                should be "KEY_Y")

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Gestures </strong>
                        This action disables mouse movement while the button is pressed and allows you to
                        assign actions for each direction. The possible directions are <code>Up</code>,
                        <code>Down</code>, <code>Left</code>, <code>Right</code>,
                        and <code>None</code>. Note that any button can be used as a gesture button if the device
                        supports
                        gestures. Additionally, some scroll wheels can have their up/down or left/right scrolls mapped
                        to some gestures. Gesture modes will state their scroll wheel compatibility in the
                        documentation.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>gestures </strong>
                                This is a required array of gesture objects that map a direction to a gesture
                                mode and
                                an action. e.g. <code>gestures: ( { gesture object }, { gesture object } ... );</code>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>direction </strong>
                                This is a required string field in a gesture object that defines the direction
                                of the
                                gesture. (e.g. <code>direction: "Up"</code>) </li>
                            <li><strong>threshold </strong>
                                This is an optional integer field that determines the number of pixels at
                                which a
                                gesture should activate. (e.g. <code>threshold: 50</code>). This value must be greater
                                than 0. If
                                not set
                                or set to an invalid value, the threshold will default to 50 pixels. </li>
                            <li><strong>mode </strong>
                                This is an optional string field that defines the mode of the gesture. This field
                                defaults
                                to <code>OnRelease</code> if it is omitted. The following is a list of gesture modes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>NoPress </strong>
                                        This mode does nothing. The <code>action</code> field is ignored when this mode
                                        is used.
                                        This
                                        gesture is compatible with scroll </li> wheels. <li>OnRelease This mode presses
                                        and
                                        releases an
                                        action when the gesture button is released. This gesture is not compatible with
                                        scroll
                                        wheels.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>OnInterval </strong>
                                        This mode presses and releases an action after the mouse is moved
                                        every n
                                        pixels (where n is the integer field <code>interval</code>). This gesture is
                                        compatible
                                        with scroll
                                        wheels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>OnThreshold </strong>
                                        Activates once the <code>threshold</code> is met, and never again.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Axis </strong>
                                        This mode maps a gesture movement to an axis. The axis is defined as a string
                                        (e.g.
                                        "REL_WHEEL") in the <code>axis</code> field and the multiplier for its movement
                                        is
                                        defined in the
                                        <code>axis_multiplier</code> field. For a list of axis strings, refer to <a

                                This is an optional field that will determine what sensor the DPI will switch on. This

                                This field may either be an integer representing the host number (one-indexed, as
                                shown on
                                the bottom of the mouse), "next" to go to the next host number, or "prev"/"previous" to
                                go to
                                the previous host number. (e.g. <code>host = 2;</code> or <code>host = "next";</code>).

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>workers</strong>
        This is an optional field that determines the number of worker threads that logid's workqueue uses. (e.g.
        <code>workers =
        4;</code>)

        This defaults to 4 if no value is given.

        **Warning:** Decreasing the worker thread count is likely to result in reduced performance and
        counter-intuitively,
        more
        threads being created (since the workqueue will run a task in a new thread if it is busy for more than
        500ms).

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>io_timeout </strong>
        This is an optional field that determines how how many milliseconds device I/O will wait for
        before
        timing out. (e.g. <code>timeout = 2000;</code>) This defaults to 2000 ms if left blank.
    </li>
